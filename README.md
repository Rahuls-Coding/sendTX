# SendTX

An app that creates a solana account for the user and adds them into the solana contract. The user can then easily send and receive SOL to/from other users in the same program. Additonally, more crypto sending capabilities are arriving soon! (ETH network is being tested!)

## Repo Structure

- `/main` - The frontend of the app built using Next.js, styled using TailwindcSS and can be deployed using Vercel.

- `/backend` - The backend of the app built using Rust and Solana contracts. 

## About this Repo

The frontend of this project is nearly complete. The backend is still in development and will be updated soon.

Note, sendTX is still being built, the latest updates will open-sourced as soon as it secured and safe to publish to the public.
